# guitarnoize_meteor
Meteor reading in GuitarNoize.com blog content from Wordpress JSON rest api which then saves to MongoDB to serve as a cache for future page loads. I call an update server method on page render to get the latest posts and push to the db using upsert to ensure only the new posts are inserted. Then the subscribe in the autorun function reactively updates the collection of posts. When you click on a post it retrieves it from the DB rather than do another API call.
